## What is this?

This package exports a function which can be used to create a
[language server][] based on [unified][] processors.
It can do the following:

*   format documents based on a unified processor
*   validate documents based on a unified processor
*   support configuration files (such as `.remarkrc`) using
    [`unified-engine`][unified-engine]

**unified** is a project that validates and transforms content with abstract
syntax trees (ASTs).
**unified-engine** is an engine to process multiple files with unified using
configuration files.
**language server** is a standardized language independent way for creating
editor integrations.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you want to create a language server for an existing
unified ecosystem.
Ideally this should follow the same rules as a CLI for this ecosystem created
using [`unified-args`][unified-args].
The resulting package may then be used to create plugins for this ecosystem for
various editors.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unified-language-server
```

## Use

Let’s say you want to create a language server for [remark][].

Create a file names `package.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "remark-language-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bin": "./index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "remark": "^14.0.0",
    "unified-language-server": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Then create `index.js` with the following content:

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import {createUnifiedLanguageServer} from 'unified-language-server'

process.title = 'remark-language-server'

createUnifiedLanguageServer({
  ignoreName: '.remarkignore',
  packageField: 'remarkConfig',
  pluginPrefix: 'remark',
  rcName: '.remarkrc',
  processorName: 'remark',
  processorSpecifier: 'remark',
  defaultProcessor: remark
})
```

That’s all there is to it.
You have just created a language server for remark.

## API

### `createUnifiedLanguageServer(options)`

Create a language server for a unified ecosystem.

##### `options`

Configuration for `unified-engine` and the language server.

###### `options.processorName`

The package ID of the expected processor (`string`, required, example:
`'remark'`).
Will be loaded from the local workspace.

###### `options.processorSpecifier`

The specifier to get the processor on the resolved module (`string`, optional,
default: `'default'`).
For example, remark uses the specifier `remark` to expose its processor and
a default export can be requested by passing `'default'` (the default).

###### `options.defaultProcessor`

Optional fallback processor to use if `processorName` can’t be found
locally in `node_modules` ([`Unified`][unified], optional).
This can be used to ship a processor with your package, to be used if no
processor is found locally.
If this isn’t passed, a warning is shown if `processorName` can’t be found.

###### `options.ignoreName`

Name of ignore files to load (`string`, optional).

###### `options.packageField`

Property at which configuration can be found in package.json files (`string`,
optional).

###### `options.pluginPrefix`

Optional prefix to use when searching for plugins (`string`, optional).

###### `options.plugins`

Plugins to use by default (`Array|Object`, optional).

###### `options.rcName`

Name of configuration files to load (`string`, optional).

## Examples

For examples, see the following projects:

*   `redot-language-server`
    (coming soon)
*   `rehype-language-server`
    (coming soon)
*   [`remark-language-server`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-language-server)

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports an `Options` type, which specifies the interface of the accepted
options.

## Language Server features

Language servers created using this package implement the following language
server features:

*   `textDocument/codeAction`
    — the language server implements code actions based on the `expected` field
    on reported messages.
    A code action can either insert, replace, or delete text based on the range
    of the message and the expected value.
*   `textDocument/didChange`
    — when a document is changed by the client, the language server processes it
    using a unified pipeline.
    Any messages collected are published to the client using
    `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.
*   `textDocument/didClose`
    — when a document is closed by the client, the language server resets
    diagnostics by publishing an empty array using
    `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.
*   `textDocument/didOpen`
    — when a document is opened by the client, the language server processes it
    using a unified pipeline.
    Any messages collected are published to the client using
    `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.
*   `textDocument/formatting`
    — when document formatting is requested by the client, the language server
    processes it using a unified pipeline.
    The stringified result is returned.
*   `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` and `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders`
    — when the client signals a watched file or workspace has changed, the
    language server processes all open files using a unified pipeline.
    Any messages collected are published to the client using
    `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This project uses [`vscode-languageserver`][vscode-languageserver] 7, which
implements language server protocol 3.17.0.
It should work anywhere where LSP 3.6.0 or later is implemented.
